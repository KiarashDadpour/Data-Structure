### This Python code implements Strassen's algorithm, a divide-and-conquer approach for multiplying square matrices.

### Functionality
#### $ Efficient Matrix Multiplication: Implements Strassen's algorithm to perform matrix multiplication for square matrices with dimensions that are a power of 2 (2^n x 2^n).
#### $ Input Validation: Ensures that input matrices are of equal size and have a valid dimension for Strassen's algorithm.
#### $ Sub-matrix Operations: Defines functions for basic matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and splitting matrices into sub-matrices.
#### $ Recursive Approach: Divides matrices recursively into smaller sub-matrices until they become single elements, then performs multiplications and combines the results using recursive calculations.
#### $ Clear Structure: The code is well-structured with functions for specific tasks, enhancing readability and maintainability.
